# C Style

## Naming

- Every module (roughly: one `.c`/`.h` pair) picks a short `PascalCase`
  prefix and uses it everywhere: `Elf_`, `Link_`, `Str_`, `Ast_`.
- Public functions are `Prefix_VerbNoun`, e.g. `Elf_BufReserve`,
  `Link_PlaceSections`. The verb comes first; avoid `Prefix_NounVerb`.
- Types are `Prefix_Noun` (`Link_Options`, `Ast_Node`). Struct tags match
  their typedef name.
- Struct/union fields get a short lowercase tag derived from the type name,
  underscore, then the field name: `Link_Options` fields start `lo_`,
  `Ast_Node` fields start `an_`. This makes a field unambiguous when read
  out of context (in a debugger, a grep, an error message).
- Macros and enum constants are `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`, prefixed with the
  module or type name: `ELF_LINK_MAX_PLACE`, `AST_NODE_KIND_ADD`.
- Every number that means something gets a name, even when the meaning looks
  obvious. `8` is `EMU_X86_64_BITS_PER_BYTE` or `EMU_X86_64_STACK_SLOT`
  depending on which 8 it is, and that difference is the point: the name says
  which quantity a reader is looking at, and a grep for it finds every place
  that quantity is assumed. Only 0 and 1 as plain counts or flags, and an
  index stepping through a loop, are exempt.
- Local variables and parameters are short, lowercase, no prefix.

## Layout

- Indent with 4 spaces. No tabs, except where the tool requires them
  (Makefile recipe lines).
- Function definitions put the opening `{` on its own line. Control-flow
  statements (`if`, `for`, `while`, `switch`) put `{` on the same line as
  the keyword.
- Always brace a controlled block, even a single statement.
- Every `switch` case is a braced block written `case X: { ... } break;`,
  with the `break` after the closing brace. No one-line cases, and an empty
  body still gets its `{ }` with `// empty` inside, so a reader can tell a
  deliberate no-op from an unfinished one. Labels that share a body stack
  above it, and the brace opens on the last one.
- Negation is written `! x`, not `!x` — a bare `!` reads too easily as a
  typo or gets lost before a long expression.
- Casts are written `(type) expr` with a space, not `(type)expr`.
- Struct and enum members align their names/values in columns. Local
  variables do not: declare each with a single space after its type.
- Order local declarations shortest first, by the length of the type plus
  the name, where the code allows it — `int x;`, then `char *hello;`, then
  `unsigned long long big;`. A local that depends on an earlier one follows
  it, and that wins over the length order.
- `sizeof` always takes parentheses: `sizeof(int)`, `sizeof(*item)`,
  `sizeof(buf)` — never `sizeof buf`.
- Keep lines within roughly 100 columns. Calls and declarations are the
  exception: a function declaration, definition or call stays on one line
  however long it gets, never wrapped across two.

## Structure

- Don't make functions `static`. Every function is declared in the module's
  header, so the header reads as a complete overview of what the `.c` file
  is and does. A reader should not have to open the `.c` to find out what is
  in it.
- File-scope variables are the opposite: keep them `static` and out of the
  header, unless another module genuinely needs one (`Ast_Program`).
- A `.c` file defines things in the same order its header declares them, so
  the two can be read side by side.
- A `.c` file is laid out in this order: includes, defines, enums, structs,
  global variables, static global variables, function definitions. Defines,
  enums and structs belong in the header where they can be, so most `.c`
  files start at the variables.

## Comments

Comments are load-bearing, not decorative. Every comment should tell the
reader something the code cannot: intent, a non-obvious invariant, a reason
a workaround exists, or what a name abbreviates. A comment that only
restates the following line in English is worse than no comment — delete it.

What gets a comment:

- **Every function** gets exactly one comment directly above it, describing
  what it does (and, if not obvious from the signature, why it exists or
  what it assumes). One line normally suffices; wrap to a second only when
  genuinely necessary.
- Write those in the imperative: `// Emit a REX prefix`, not `// Emits a
  REX prefix`. Every verb in the sentence follows, including after `and`
  or `or` — `// Show usage information and exit`. A verb with its own
  subject keeps its own form (`// The section it patches`), and comments
  that are noun phrases rather than sentences stay as they are
  (`// True if name was declared`, `// Jumps, calls and returns`).
- **Every macro, typedef, struct, and enum** gets one comment above it for
  the same reason. Struct fields and enum constants that aren't
  self-explanatory get a short trailing `// comment` instead of one above.
- **Section dividers** are allowed to group related declarations in a
  header, or related phases inside a long function (`// Phase: ...`), when
  the grouping itself is information.
- A short inline comment is allowed at a specific line where the code does
  something surprising (a non-obvious flag, a deliberate deviation, a
  workaround for an external constraint) — never to narrate normal control
  flow.

What does not get a comment:

- Do not describe *what* a line of code does when the code already says so
  in plain identifiers. Name things well instead of commenting them.
- Do not leave commented-out code, TODOs-as-narration, or changelog-style
  notes ("added X for the Y fix") — that belongs in commit messages, not
  source.
- Do not add a comment just because a block "looks like it needs one" —
  build configuration, glue code and boilerplate are commented only where a
  choice in them is non-obvious, never by default.

If you can't point to what a comment tells the reader beyond the code
itself, delete it.
